    "Our toolkit will consist of several computer tools -- most are freely available.  We will also use a variety of books and web references.  The offical OS for the course is Windows 10 (this the OS installed in our labs and on my computers).  However, virtually all of the software that we will use is also available for OSX (Mac) and Linux.  I will try to assist where I can, but I do not have much experience with installing the software in these environments.\n"
