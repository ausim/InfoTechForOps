    "# Course Toolkit and Reference Tools\n",
    "Our toolkit will consist of several computer tools -- most are freely available.  We highly recommend that you install the course toolkit on your personal computer (if you have one available).  The toolkit will be installed in the ISE computer labs, but you will have much more flexibility using your own.  You should also feel free to bring your notebook computers to class.\n",

    "The offical OS for the course is Windows 10 (this the OS installed in our labs and on my computers).  However, virtually all of the software that we will use is also available for OSX (Mac) and Linux.  I will try to assist where I can, but I do not have much experience with installing the software in these environments.\n",

    "We will also use a variety of books and web references - provided in the section below (note that I will update this as the semester progresses).\n"

Below is a small set that I've specifically identified for this course -- so, don't think of this as any type of comprehensive list.  One of the key skills that you will need is to search the web for material and for answers to specific questions that you will have throughout the semester.\n",

The standard installation includes most of Python-related packages that we will use in the class and other packages can be easily installed and managed using the Conda package manager (https://conda.io/docs/).
